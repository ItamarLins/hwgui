List:  Samples not running or have bugs (Fix bugs, if time available, low priority):
  1.) WinAPI
      grid_5.prg     crashes, if click on button "Change": 
                     Hint: commenting out this line without crash:
                     //   ADD COLUMN TO GRIDEDIT aItems FIELD "Field_2" LABEL "Char" PICTURE "@!" //READONLY
      nice2.prg      Seems to be outdated, starts only in background, kill with Task Manager
      tab.prg        missing function(s): hb_enumIndex(), resource DIALOG_1 not working
      testchild.prg  child window not created ! command seems to be outdated.
      testtray.prg   No exported method: HANDLE
      testrtf.prg    Created Rich text files are corrupted, see bug ticket #37 (text above).

  2.) GTK
      tstsplash.prg  works for WinAPI, but background for splash window on GTK empty:
                     INIT DIALOG ... BACKGROUND BITMAP ...
      a.prg          Browse problem with Char field
      escrita.prg    LINUX: Text in toolbuttons not visible, OK on cross development GTK/Win
      progbars.prg   LINUX: Progbar create ok, but press button "Step" the progbar disappeared.
      tstscrlbar.prg Compilable, but no scroll function


some work for hwreport:

missing functions _HB_FUN_OPENREPORT()
HWG_WAITRUN(<file>),
resource file only for Borland C.
Lots of warnings about AMBIGIUOS REFERENCE
some work for hwmake:
Some bugs adding files and libs.
Validation for class WinPrn.


Add feature: Label utility.
It is an important feature for business application for
example to label envelopes of letters to customers.
In CLLOG it is necessary for QSL cards.
The label editor is almost implememented in Clipper
utility RL.EXE, in S'87 as LABEL.EXE
and is also supported by Harbour.
The console version of CLLOG also supports label.
There is also an label editor as console application
available.
This must be ported to HWGUI using the WinPrn class.
