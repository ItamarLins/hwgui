 Special instructions for migration of HWGUI from GTK2 to GTK3
 
 
1.) Additional instructions for developers of HWGUI applications

The migration must be done carefully "Step by Step".
So be patient, if all sample programs for GTK2 are running on
GTK3 with no trouble.

2.1) Compiling the HWGUI application

Look into a sample hbp file in directoy samples to
include the hbc files 

{win}../hwgui.hbc
# GTK2
{linux}../hwgui.hbc
# GTK3: Deactivate previous line
# and activate following line
#{linux}../hwguiGTK3.hbc

so modify to:
# {linux}../hwgui.hbc
 ...
{linux}../hwguiGTK3.hbc

2.2) Compiler switches

Use these compiler switches to make code for
GTK2 and GTK3:

C files:


#if GTK_MAJOR_VERSION -0 < 3   
   /* GTK2 */
   ...
#else
   /* GTK3 */
   ...
#endif

or


#if ! ( GTK_MAJOR_VERSION -0 < 3 )   
   /* GTK3 */
   ...
#endif   

PRG files:

#ifdef ___GTK3___
   * GTK3
   ...
#else   
   * GTK2
   ...
#endif



2.) Run the application with GTK3

Ignore this message at start displayed in the terminal window:  
Gtk-CRITICAL : New application windows must be added after the GApplication::startup signal has been emitted.


3.) TO-DO list and list of problems to solve

- INIT DIALOG crashes with access violation
- How to set a background image
- How to display an icon (see test/icon.c)
- Check all samples for GTK3, only those running on GTK2.
